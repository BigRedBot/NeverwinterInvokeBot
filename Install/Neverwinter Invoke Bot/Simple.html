<br><div style="text-align: center">Use this referral link to create an account with Simple bank:
<br>
<br><a href="https://simple.com/friends/D3B6CY4">https://simple.com/friends/D3B6CY4</a>
<br>
<br>And when you use the Simple card for the first time, we will both receive $20 each. How cool is that?</div>
<br>
<br>Simple is a completely feeless FDIC insured bank with no minimums. They don't even have overdraft fees, so there is no catch. You just need to be a U.S. citizen that is 18 or older.
<br>
<br>You can have your paycheck direct deposited, use the app to cash checks from your smartphone, or transfer money from an existing bank account. Then you can use the Simple card to pay for things or withdraw cash at many participating fee-free ATM's. (A fee-free ATM finder is also included in the app.)
<br>
<br>And after you create your account, you can also have your friends and family create an account under you with your referral link, so that both of you can get another $20 each. There are no limits to how many people can sign up under you.
