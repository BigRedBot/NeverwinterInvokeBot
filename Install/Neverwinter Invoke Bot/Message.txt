I have never complained about others sharing the unlock code with others. I only added the unlock code to show people that, I would really like some compensation for putting in the work to create and maintain this.

But now I see that there are others who are publicly sharing this to everyone with the code included.

I don't even care if people are cheap and use this without paying me. I just want them to know that the money that I have received for this is the only thing that has allowed me to pay my bills so far. I didn't even have any money to buy my children Christmas presents this year.

I actually don't mind if someone who is low on money does steal this from me. I can relate to not having much money. I just want everyone who uses this to know that, if they could spare the money, I could sure use it...
