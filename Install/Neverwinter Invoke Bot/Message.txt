So that I can continue to fund my efforts, I plan on adding an unlock code for the extra utilities that I have added: Mail Bot, Auction Bot, Guild Bank RP Bot, and the Fishing Bot

Everything else will function with no charge, such as the invoke bot and collecting rewards, but I will be asking for $9.99 to unlock the extra utilities.

The utilities are currently unlocked and will be usable for free until mod 15 is released. At that point, I hope that you will support this project by buying the utilities unlock code.

Mod 15 will completely break profession support.

I currently have no plans to continue support for professions. Please understand that no refunds will be given for those who have purchased the unlock keys.

For those who unlocked profession support without paying for the unlock code, I am sure you probably don't have the money to spare, so, I have no hard feelings about it. :)

Thank you all who have supported this project, it has helped me more than you will ever know.
