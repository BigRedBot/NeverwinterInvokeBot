# Neverwinter Invoke Bot

Mod 15 will completely break profession support.

I currently have no plans to continue support for professions. Please understand that no refunds will be given for those who have purchased the unlock keys.

This script currently supports the Russian game client.

&nbsp;

- For this script to work, the **Interface scale** in the **Options** must be set to **1.00**, in the **General** section of the **Interface** tab.  
- I also recommend a screen resolution of no greater than **1920x1080**. This script may not work properly with higher resolutions.  
- For the VIP collection, you need to increase the size of your in game inventory window, so that the script can see the buttons it needs to click on. It will not attempt to scroll the inventory window for you.

It is a false positive. Please read here for more information about this:

So that I can continue to fund my efforts, I have added an unlock code for the extra utilities that I have added: **Mail Bot**, **Auction Bot**, **Guild Bank RP Bot**, and the **Fishing Bot**

**Mail Bot**: Opens mail for you by removing the item and then deleting the mail.

**Auction Bot**: Has a predefined list of items that can be posted to the auction house for you.

**Guild Bank RP Bot**: Removes refining stones from your Guild Bank tab that you have permissions to.

**Fishing Bot**: Will fish for you.
