# Neverwinter Invoke Bot

Mod 15 will completely break profession support.

I currently have no plans to continue support for professions. Please understand that no refunds will be given for those who have purchased the unlock keys.

For those who unlocked profession support without paying for the unlock code, I am sure you probably don't have the money to spare, so, I have no hard feelings about it. :)

Thank you all who have supported this project, it has helped me more than you will ever know.

Now supports the Russian game client.

- For this script to work, the **Interface scale** in the **Options** must be set to **1.00**, in the **General** section of the **Interface** tab.  
- I also recommend a resolution of no greater than 1920x1080. This script may not work properly with higher resolutions.  
- For the VIP collection, you need to increase the size of your in game inventory window, so that the script can see the buttons it needs to click on. It will not attempt to scroll the inventory for you.
